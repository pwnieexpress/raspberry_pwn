v0.2.6 (20100621)
* Feature:  svcrash.py is a new tool for sending messages that crash svwar and 
            svcrack

* Bug fix:  helper.py has been fixed when decoding the tags (svcrash abuses 
            this issue)

v0.2.5 (20100519)
* Feature:  svwar.py has "scan for default / typical extensions" option. This
	    option tries to guess numeric extensions which have certain patterns
	    such as 1212 etc. Option is -D, --enabledefaults

* General:  svwar.py and svcrack.py now have a new option which allows you to set
	    how long the tools will scan without receiving any response back.
	    This allows us to prevent flooding the target. Some PBX servers now
	    have built-in firewalls / intrusion prevention systems which will
	    blacklist the IP address of anyone using svwar or svcrack. Therefore
	    if the IP is blacklisted it makes sense to stop scanning the target.
	    The default for this option is 10 seconds. Set this option by using
	    --maximumtime [seconds]

* Removed:  svlearnfp.py is now discontinued. The tool is still included for
	    historic reasons but disabled.

* Feature:  svmap.py now includes the following new features:
			--debug - shows messages as they are received (useful for
				    developers)
			--first - scans the first X number of hosts, useful for
				    random or large address pool scanning
			--inputtext - scans IP ranges taken from a text file
			--fromname - sets the from header to something specific
				    useful for abusing other security issues or
				    when svmap is used in a more flexible way
				    then usual ;-)

* Feature:  svreport.py now has two new modes:
			- stats, which lists some statistics
			- search, allows you to search through logs looking for
				    specific user agents

* Bug fix:  svwar.py now by default does not send ACK messages (was a buggy feature
	    that did not follow the standard)

* Bug fix:  svwar.py - the template passed through --template option is now checked
	    sanity. 

v0.2.4
* Feature:  svwar.py can now scan for templated numbers. This allows more flexible
            usage of ranges of numbers, allowing for prefixes and suffixes as
            need be ;-)

* Bug fix:  svwar.py now sends ACK to be nice to other devices.

* Bug fix:  each tag is padded with a unique 32 bit

* Bug fix:  Contact header is always added to the request to always send well
            formed SIP requests
            
* Bug fix:  Large data is sent fragmented now (mysendto)

* Bug fix:  svwar.py now handles new SIP response codes

v0.2.3
* Feature:  Fingerprinting support for svmap. Included fphelper.py and 
            3 databases used for fingerprinting. 

* Feature:  Added svlearnfp.py which allows one to add new signatures to 
            db and send them to the author.
            
* Feature:  Added DNS SRV check to svmap. Use ./svmap.py --srv domainname.com
            to give it a try

v0.2.svn
* Feature:  added the ability for svreport to count results when doing a list

* Bug fix:  fixed a bug related to resuming a scan which does not have an
	    an extension

v0.2.1 (maintenance)
General:
* Feature:  updated the report function to include more information about
	    the system. Python version and operating system is now included 
	    in the bug report. option now supports optional feedback.

* Feature:  Store information about the state of a session. Sessions can be 
	complete or incomplete, so that you can resume incomplete sessions 
	but not complete ones.

* Feature:  Added -e option to svmap. Allows you to specify an extension. This
	is useful when using -m INVITE options on a SIP phone.

* Bug fix:  Added a check to make sure that the python version is supported. 
	Anything less than version 2.4 is not supported

* Bug fix:  IP in the SIP msg was being set to localhost when not explicitly 
	set. This is not correct behavior and was fixed. As a result of this 
	behavior some devices, such as Grandstream BT100 were not being detected.
	Thanks to robert&someone from bulgaria for reporting this

* Bug fix:  fixed a bug in the database which was reported anonymously via the --reportback / -R option.
	Thanks whoever reported that. Bug concerns the dbm which does not
	support certain methods supported other database modules referenced
	by anydbm. Reproduced on FreeBSD. Thanks to Anthony Williams for help i
	dentifying this

* Bug fix:  Ranges of extensions in svwar could not take long numeric extensions
	(xrange does not support long / large numbers). Thanks to Joern for reporting this

* Bug fix:  svwar was truncating extension names containing certain characters. Fixed.

* Bug fix:  when binding to a specific interface, the IP within the SIP message could be incorrect (when there are multiple interfaces). This has been fixed.

* Cosmetic: Certain PBXs reply with "603 Declined" when svwar finds that the
	extension does not exist. This creates extra noise. It is now being
	suppressed.

v0.2
General:
* Feature: replaced 3rd party functions in ip4range with our functions in helper.py
* Feature: ReportBack function is off by default but can be enabled by using -R option
* Feature: verbose and quiet mode. Now making use of logging module
* Newtool: svreport - export to csv, pdf, xml and plain text. 
* Feature: session / database support. This allows two things:
	- resuming of previous scans
	- exporting the results to more meaningful formats
* Feature: give a warning when the default port is already being used and listen on another port


Svmap:
* Feature: Host arguments now accepts a variety of formats. You can now scan using ranges like the following:
	- 1.1.1.1-20 1.1.1-20.1-10
	- 1.1.1.*
	- 1.1.1.1-1.1.2.20
	- sipvicious.org/22
* Bug fix: Generation of hosts to scan is now dynamic and does not slow down startup time
* Feature: Now making use of the standard logging module with more logging to debug problems
* Feature: When the port is already bound, svmap tries to listen on another port
* Feature: Added options to allow you to specify the ip to bind to as well as the external ip address of the scanner
* Feature: --help now shows proper usage
* Feature: New scanning method - random scan! This scans only valid internet address space.
* Feature: Randomize scan. Allows you to randomize the order of the IP addresses to be scanned. 

Svwar:
* Bug fix: Svwar was missing valid extensions (false negatives) - fixed
* Bug fix: Logic bug which did not identify between a server that does not respond and one that sends an unexpected response.
* Bug fix: Fixed description of errors and usage

Svcrack:
* General: --help output was updated to match the other tools. 

Svreport:
* General: was born. Allows managing of saved sessions and exporting to different file formats.
* Feature: Reverse name lookup for ip addresses

v0.1
First release.
